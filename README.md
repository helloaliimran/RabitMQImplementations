# RabitMQ - Implementations - Sender Application

RabbitMQ is an open source message broker software.

Message Broker: 1. message queue & message orinted middleware. 

A message broker acts as a middleman for various services. They can be used to reduce loads and delivery times of web application servers by delegating tasks that would normally take up a lot of time or resources to a third party that has no other job.
